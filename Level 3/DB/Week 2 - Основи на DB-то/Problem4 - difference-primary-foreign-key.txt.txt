Primary key(PK) - uniquely identify each row in the table.
 - When you specify a primary key constraint for a table, the Database Engine enforces data uniqueness by automatically creating a unique index for the primary key columns. This index also permits fast access to data when the primary key is used in queries. If a primary key constraint is defined on more than one column, values may be duplicated within one column, but each combination of values from all the columns in the primary key constraint definition must be unique.
 - A table can contain only one primary key constraint.
 - A primary key cannot exceed 16 columns and a total key length of 900 bytes.
 - The index generated by a primary key constraint cannot cause the number of indexes on the table to exceed 999 nonclustered indexes and 1 clustered index.
 - If clustered or nonclustered is not specified for a primary key constraint, clustered is used if there no clustered index on the table.
 - All columns defined within a primary key constraint must be defined as not null. If nullability is not specified, all columns participating in a primary key constraint have their nullability set to not null.
 - If a primary key is defined on a CLR user-defined type column, the implementation of the type must support binary ordering.

Foreign key(FK) -  is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables to control the data that can be stored in the foreign key table.
