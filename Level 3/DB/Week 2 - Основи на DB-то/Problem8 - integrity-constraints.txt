Data integrity refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life-cycle,[1] and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. Data integrity is the opposite of data corruption, which is a form of data loss.
