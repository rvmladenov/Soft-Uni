- NoSQL encompasses a wide variety of different database technologies that were developed in response to a rise in the volume of data stored about users, objects and products, the frequency in which this data is accessed, and performance and processing needs.

- The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value) differ from those used in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL and others faster in relational databases. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve.

- When compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance, and their data model addresses several issues that the relational model is not designed to address.

- NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.[3] NoSQL systems are also called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may also support SQL-like query languages
