A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields(also known as columns) and rows.

In relational databases and flat file databases, a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.
