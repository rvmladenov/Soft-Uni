Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy("data redundancy" is the existence of data that is additional to the actual data and permits correction of errors in stored or transmitted data).
- Normalization involves refactoring a table into smaller (and less redundant) tables but without losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
