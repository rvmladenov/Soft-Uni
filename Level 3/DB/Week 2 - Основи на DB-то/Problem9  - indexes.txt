- Advantages: use an index for quick access to a database table specific information. The index is a structure of the database table the value of one or more columns to sort
As a general rule, only when the data in the index column Frequent queries, only need to create an index on the table. The index take up disk space and reduce to add, delete, and update the line speed. In most cases, the speed advantages of indexes for data retrieval greatly exceeds it. 

- Disadvantages: too index will affect the speed of update and insert, because it requires the same update each index file. For a frequently updated and inserted into the table, there is no need for a rarely used where the words indexed separately, small table, the cost of sorting will not be great, there is no need to create additional indexes. In some cases, the indexing words may not be fast, for example, the index is placed in a contiguous memory space, which will increase the burden of disk read, which is optimal, it should be through the actual use of the environment to be tested.
